# UK E-commerce Data Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing real-world UK e-commerce transactional data using SQL to uncover insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product demand, returns, and time-based purchasing patterns.

The dataset contains line-level order information, meaning each order can have multiple products. The analysis was designed carefully to aggregate data at the correct business level (order, customer, product, and time).

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills used in real analytics and freelancing work, not just academic queries.
