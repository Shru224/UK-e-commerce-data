# 📦 UK E-commerce Data Analysis (Excel | SQL | Python | Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes UK-based e-commerce transaction data to uncover insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product demand, returns, and time-based purchasing patterns.

It demonstrates a **complete, end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data cleaning and ending with an interactive business dashboard.

The dataset contains **line-level transaction data**, meaning each order can include multiple products. Special care was taken to aggregate data at the correct business level (order, customer, product, and time) to ensure accurate insights.

## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow
1. **Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. **SQL (MySQL)** – Metric validation and structured analysis  
3. **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Exploratory & behavioral analysis  
4. **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for stakeholder reporting

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)
The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared in **Excel** before loading into MySQL.

### Key data cleaning steps:
- Removed fully empty rows
- Standardized column formats
- Handled missing `CustomerID` values by labeling them as `Unknown`
- Ensured identifier columns (`InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`) were treated as text due to alphanumeric values
- Created derived columns:
  - `InvoiceYear`
  - `InvoiceMonth`
  - `InvoiceHour`
  - `InvoiceDay`
  - `LineRevenue` (Quantity × UnitPrice)
- Preserved negative quantities to correctly represent product returns
- Ensured date and time fields were properly formatted

The cleaned dataset served as the **single source of truth** for all downstream analysis.
